# Big-Data-Project
The project's purpose is to conduct a predictive analysis to understand the factors influencing online shopping behavior and predict the likelihood of a purchase. Using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the project aims to analyze user interactions on an e-commerce platform, such as page visits, session timings, and traffic sources. Advanced modeling techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks, were applied in SAS Enterprise Miner to identify the most significant predictors of purchasing intentions.

Key features include:

1. Identifying influential variables, such as Exit Rates, Page Values, Visitor Type, and browsers used, that impact purchasing behavior.
2. Comparing different models to determine the most accurate predictor of purchase likelihood, where the Neural Network model with 5 hidden units and 50 iterations emerged as the best-performing model.
3. Providing actionable insights for optimizing e-commerce platforms, enhancing user experiences, and improving sales conversion rates.
